                <h1>Lesson 2: Who is Your Audience??</h1>
                <p>Designing for your Audience & keeping the User’s in the forefront of your mind help to ensure your
                  App will be a Success. Once you are familiar with your User and understand how your App will be of
                  service to them, you will become a better Developer.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>Targeting Your Audience</h3>
                  When we decide to Target our Audience, we really mean to say we would like to select the individuals
                  who will benefit the most from using our App. This approach allows us to narrow down our audience from
                  every individual on the planet to select individuals who will enjoy the App first. We must first
                  identify these people, gather initial data about the users and find out if any other individuals would
                  share these interests to grow a strategy.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>Identify your Users</h3>
                  The particular users you are looking for tend to become obvious when you have designed the App Idea.
                  Select people you know who would regularly use and enjoy the App. Build
                  a Profile from these people and ask yourself, what reason would my imaginary person have for
                  downloading and using this app? If you can answer this question, you may just have a really good
                  idea!<br><br>

                  The next step is to start thinking practically. What Return on Investment can I expect to make from
                  Developing this App? A Return on Investment is what you receive upon completing the App Development
                  Journey. Marketing Strategies early on have been proven to increase the number of downloads and
                  broaden your App’s Visibility on the Play Store. By Identifying who these people are, you can contact
                  Marketing Teams to Promote your App for you. <br><br><br>

                  <h3>Do Your Research</h3>
                  By Identifying your User, you can begin to learn more about a typical user. Finding out Market
                  Research such as What Age-Group they belong to or what Country they are from allows you to make
                  initial assumptions about the typical user of your App, where you might be more successful if devising
                  a marketing campaign when launching the App. A relevantly easy way to capture this data is to check
                  out reviews of competitors and what sort of age group or users are giving the app positive
                  ratings.<br><br>

                  Sending out Surveys using a survey provider like surveymonkey.com can help you to gather data faster.
                  Simply by posting a link online, you can have access to a wide range of users who would be willing to
                  help you with your App Idea and give you any insights as
                  to what might be needed in the Development of the App. Focus Groups of people you know or perhaps
                  individuals in your community that would benefit your app are one of the best way to research your
                  audience. Face-to-face communication is by far the best form of communication as it allows you to pick
                  up when someone is holding back or not being completely honest.<br><br>

                  By gathering initial data, you’ll find yourself getting more excited about the App’s purpose. It may
                  even be a case that you haven’t quite figured out your App Idea yet, by following this process, you’ll
                  be able to get a better understanding of what your users are looking for.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>Gather Data</h3>
                  When doing this research, it is easy to complete the simple tasks like setting up the survey and
                  asking people for their responses. What tends to be the tricky part is compiling the data that you
                  have gathered. It is useless unless you can draw a conclusion from it all.<br><br>

                  A Good place to start is with the Market Data you have gathered. Find out exactly<br><br>

                  what % of the Market your competition has. Will your App be stronger and more valuable than their App?
                  Are you looking to take all the current users, or only a small portion? If there are any gaps in their
                  service, you should always look to fill in this service with your App. By undercutting the competition
                  and providing more value for less, you will be able to convert more users from the existing Apps to
                  yours.<br><br>

                  Setting realistic goals early-on allows you to see the value of your App. In turn you can assess how
                  much time and money you are able to invest in your App Idea at this stage. (Sometimes it’s better to
                  incubate your original idea while you build up the technical skillset to implement it!) An example of
                  this in action is the Parento Principle.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
                  For Many Events, roughly 80% of the Effects come from 20% of the Causes.<br><br>

                  This can be applied to what we should expect in terms of a Return on Investment. In the Mobile Game
                  Industry, 50% of generated revenue comes from 0.5% of the Users. Meaning 1 particular group of Users
                  are will to spend massively more amounts than others. <br><br><br>

                  <h3>Who Is Your User?</h3>
                  To begin understanding “Who is Going to use my App?” we’ll need to start creating a User Profile.
                  Creating a Persona Title for your User helps you to understand who this person is and what they will
                  benefit from in your App. Once you have started giving your Users a Title you’ll be able to visualize
                  who these people are and what they like and do for a living. <br><br>

                  This can impact on how your Users might use your App because really you are designing the App to best
                  suit them! Once you have a few Samples of Typical Users who will use your App you can add their
                  profile to your App Design Document. The point here is to start getting into the mindset of your User.
                  Perhaps they aren’t Tech-Savvy or don’t have the same interest in Technology as you do. Is your App
                  able to accommodate users who have little to no experience using apps?<br><br><br>

                  <h3>The Most Popular App</h3>
                  Before we settle into our User Profiles, it’s worth taking note of what trends are happening in the
                  App Stores at this time. As we know, Facebook and Social Media are where our Users spend the most
                  amount of their time in Apps. This can indicate a strong reasoning that Users will likely enjoy
                  posting or searching through their established Social Networks. No need to reinvent the wheel by
                  creating a new one when we are starting out!<br><br>

                  Conversely, the Games Category currently takes up the biggest share of Categories of Apps. It is
                  definitely worth weighing up the values of stiff competition when comparing categories that your App
                  will likely fall under.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>What’s Trending</h3>
                  Who needs your Service? Find out what kind of problems have been increasingly sought after in recent
                  years. If your App is going to be used in a national or scientific problem- solving fashion, it is
                  essential that we follow trends to make sure we are on the right track. Make sure of the Google Trends
                  Tool that allows you to track what countries you can start with where the problem is most current and
                  start working to solve the problem early on.<br><br>

                  On a much more local level, you can begin by getting in touch with local communities and hosting “Tech
                  Events” (with free pizza!) to get in touch with who you can utilize for assistance, whether it is
                  graphic design, marketing or even development. This will give you an idea of how big technology is
                  impacting your area and where to begin with your first app.<br><br><br>

                  <h3>User Personas</h3>
                  Once you have a few Samples of Typical Users who will use your App you can add their profile to your
                  App Design Document. The point here is to start getting into the mindset of your User. Perhaps they
                  aren’t Tech-Savvy or don’t have the same interest in Technology as you do. Is your App able to
                  accommodate users who have little to no experience using apps?<br><br>

                  Find out what these people do to detail exactly how your App will solve their problem, are there any
                  competitors out there that are doing something similar? Perhaps they are only doing half of what is
                  needed and you’ll be able to improve the service to make it easier! Sign up to competitor’s services
                  and go through their processes, are there any things you would do differently? Is there a way to
                  simplify the process? These are crucial design questions that will set you apart from your competition
                  in the later stages of Development.<br><br>

                  Flesh out your Users Personas by asking the 5 W’s<br><br>

                  <center><strong>Who – What – Where - When – Why – How</strong></center><br><br>

                  Being able to keep your User Experience in the forefront of your Designs allows you to create a
                  greater understanding of what the Final Product that will change their lives! With that in mind, it’s
                  time to get started on Designing your App!<br><br><Br>

                  <h3>Designing your App</h3>
                  At this point we have covered a lot of information about what you can do to get started on your App
                  Idea. Let’s start looking at a practical approach to getting started. While you don’t need a formal
                  business plan for getting started, it’s good practice to put whatever knowledge you have into practice
                  before it’s too late. If you catch a mistake in the Design Process, it might save you a lot of
                  heartache in the Development Process later on. Brainstorming Ideas can be a lot of fun. Make sure to
                  stay on point and get those creative juices flowing! Here are a few Strategies for Idea
                  Building:<br><br>

                  1. Forget what you think you know <br>
                  2. Understand your User <br>
                  3. Constraints Never come First <br>
                  4. Use all Resources Available to you <br>
                  5. Keep It Simple <br><br><br>

                  <h3>Visualizing Your Idea</h3>
                  Paper Prototypes allow us to visualize the project before development has begun. They are also a great
                  way of communicating your ideas with your peers, investors and programmers. Communication is the key
                  during the Design Stage of Development and allowing the project to be interpreted graphically by your
                  team opens up the specifications needed for discussion. <br><br>

                  The Paper Prototype is a technique that allows you to create and test a User Interface quickly &
                  cheaply. It can be achieved using whichever textile methods you prefer.<br><br>

                  Whether you would like to make it out of match sticks, clay or simple pen on paper. When developing a
                  mobile application, it is easier to create the template for the phone and design what the app will
                  look like on screen in the users’ hands. The main objective from your Paper Prototype should be to
                  communicate your idea for your App clearly and effectively. Being able to test out the App will allow
                  you to catch any errors in the design and find out how people will more than likely use the App
                  without any prior knowledge of how to.
