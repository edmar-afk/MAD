                  <h4>AUDIENCE</h4>
                  <p>It’s a User-Centric World out there. You need to stay focused on who is going to use
                    your app. Creating a Profile can pretty much come from yourself or if you are lucky
                    enough to have someone in mind to use the app, you can ask them directly what they
                    make of it as you are developing the app. <br><br>

                    This is just a few paragraphs to act as a useful reminder as to who your app is aimed
                    at. It will help you to get into the mindset of the user when prototyping or testing your
                    App Idea. Not all users will have the same goals or needs that the app can provide. A
                    general rule of thumb is to keep their needs and wants simplified for design conflicts
                    and insights to the Apps Structure.

                    <br><br>

                    <h4>THE EXPERIENCE</h4>
                    A few paragraphs on what it’s like to use the App. This will come later in the Design
                    stages as you can text your Prototype. Use this early testing stage to get an idea of
                    what the look and the feel will be, the core features and the accessibility of everything.
                    This is also used to remind yourself of what experience you want the user to achieve

                    <h4>HOW WILL IT BE USED</h4>
                    It seems vitally important to consider when and where a user will be interacting with
                    your App. Context Prototyping will be helpful with this. Detail a few scenarios you
                    think when the app will be used and use them to test the features in detail. Are your
                    Users in a Rush? Are they able to make mistakes? The App must be tailored to
                    complement experiences and allow for the environment they are in. Perhaps if the
                    user will be at home mostly, more immersive absorbing color schemes should be used
                    to keep the User entertained.
